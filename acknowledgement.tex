First and foremost, I would like to thank my PhD supervisor Dr. Bruno C. d. S.
Oliveira for his continued support and mentorship throughout my studies. I would
also like to thank my co-supervisor Prof. T.H. Tse for his valuable suggestions
and guidelines. He helped revise my papers and this thesis, continuously nudging
me to make my writing more clearer. His feedback is nothing short of inspiring,
which I greatly enjoyed. Secondly, I would like to express my gratitude to Prof.
Tom Schrijvers from KU Leuven. I enjoyed very much our collaboration on a topic
of mutual interest, which lead to one of the key publications for this PhD
dissertation. I learned a lot from you! During the years I spent at HKU, I had
the opportunity to collaborate with a number of excellent fellow researchers, to
name a few, Tomas Tauber, Zhiyuan Shi, Weixin Zhang, Huang Li, Yanpeng Yang and
Ningning Xie. Last but not least, I would love to thank my family for being
extremely supportive throughout my studies. I made it through thanks to all of
you.
