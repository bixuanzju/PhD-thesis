(To be filled in with more personal details...)

First and foremost, I would like to thank my PhD supervisor Dr. Bruno C. d. S.
Oliveira for his continued support and mentorship throughout my studies. I would
also like to thank my co-supervisor Prof. T.H. Tse for his valuable suggestions
and guidelines. He helped revise my papers and this thesis, continuously nudging
me to make my writing clearer. His feedback is nothing short of inspiring, which
I greatly enjoyed. Secondly, I would like to express my gratitude to Prof. Tom
Schrijvers from KU Leuven. I enjoyed very much our collaboration on a topic of
mutual interest, which led to one of the key publications for this PhD
dissertation. I learned a lot from you! During the years I spent at HKU, I had
the opportunity to collaborate with a number of excellent fellow researchers, to
name a few, Tomas Tauber, Zhiyuan Shi, Weixin Zhang, Huang Li, Yanpeng Yang,
Ningning Xie, Yanlin Wang, Haoyuan Zhang. Last but not least, I would love to
thank my family for being extremely supportive throughout my studies. I made it
through thanks to all of you.
