\chapter{Coherence for \namee}
\label{chap:coherence:simple}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This chapter constructs a logical relation to
establish coherence of \namee. Finding a
suitable definition of coherence for \namee is already challenging in its own
right. In what follows we reproduce the steps of finding a definition for coherence
that is both intuitive and applicable. Then we present the
construction of the logical (equivalence) relation tailored to this
definition, and the connection between logical equivalence and coherence.
\Cref{chap:coherence:poly} builds on the idea in this chapter to prove coherence for
\fnamee.

\section{The Intuition}

\paragraph{Duplication is Harmless.}

While requiring that all intersections are disjoint as in \oname is sufficient
to guarantee coherence, it is not necessary. In fact, such requirement
unnecessarily encumbers the subtyping definition with disjointness constraints
and an ad-hoc treatment of ``top-like'' types. Indeed, the value $[[1 ,, 1]]$ of
the non-disjoint type $[[ nat & nat ]]$ is entirely unambiguous, and
$(\mer{1}{1}) + 3$ can obviously only result in $4$. More generally, when the
overlapping components of an intersection type have the same value, there is no
ambiguity problem. \namee uses this idea to relax \oname's enforcement of
disjointness. In the case of a merge, it is hard to statically decide whether
the two arguments have the same value, and thus \namee still requires
disjointness. Yet, disjointness is no longer required for the well-formedness of
types and overlapping intersections can be created implicitly through subtyping,
which results in duplicating values at run time. For instance, while $[[ 1,, 1]]$
is not expressible $[[ 1 : nat & nat]]$ creates the equivalent value implicitly.
% The consequence of this relaxation of disjointness is a much simplified
% type system for \namee.
In short, duplication is harmless and subtyping only generates duplicated values
for non-disjoint types.


% Coherence is easy to establish for \oname as its rigid rules mean that there is
% at most one possible subtyping derivation between any two types.  As a
% consequence there is only one possible elaboration and thus one
% possible behavior for any program.

Two factors make establishing coherence for \namee much more difficult: the
relaxation of disjointness and the adoption of the more expressive subtyping
rules from the BCD system (for which \oname lacks). These two factors mean that
subtyping proofs are no longer unique and hence that there are multiple
elaborations of the same source program. For instance, $[[ nat & nat ]]$ is a
subtype of $[[nat]]$ in two ways: by projection on either the first or second
component. Hence the fact that all elaborations yield the same result when
evaluated has become a much more subtle property that requires sophisticated
reasoning. For instance, we can see that coherence holds because at run time any
value of type $[[nat & nat]]$ has identical components, and
thus both projections yield the same result.




For \namee in general, we show coherence by capturing the non-ambiguity
invariant in a \emph{logical relation}~\citep{tait, plotkin1973lambda,
  statman1985logical} and showing that it is preserved by the operational
semantics. In doing so, we remove the brittleness of the previous syntactic
method to prove coherence. This new proof method has several advantages.
Firstly, with the new proof method, several restrictions that were enforced by
\oname to enable the syntactic proof are removed. For example, the
aforementioned \emph{top-like types} are not necessary; top-like types are
handled like all other types. Secondly, the new proof method is more powerful
because it is based on observational equivalence rather than syntactic equality;
it is more robust as the type system is extended. Finally, the removal of the
ad-hoc side-conditions makes adding new extensions, such as support for
BCD-style subtyping, easier. A complicating factor is that not one, but two
languages are involved: the source language and the target language. In order to
deal with the complexity of the elaboration semantics of \namee, we employ
binary logical relations that are heterogeneous, parameterized by two types; the
fundamental property is also reformulated to account for bidirectional
type-checking. A caveat is that our logical relation does not hold for target programs and
program contexts in general, but only for those that are the image of a
corresponding source program or program context. Thus we must view everything
through the lens of elaboration.



\section{In Search of Coherence}

In \oname the definition of coherence is based on
$\alpha$-equivalence. More specifically, their coherence property states that
any two target terms that a source expression elaborates into must be exactly the same (up to
$\alpha$-equivalence). Unfortunately this syntactic notion of coherence is
very fragile with respect to extensions.
For example, it is not obvious how to retain this notion of coherence when adding more subtyping
rules such as those in \cref{fig:subtype_decl}.

If we permit ourselves to consider only the syntactic aspects of expressions,
then very few expressions can be considered equal. The syntactic view also conflicts
with the intuition that ``the significance of an expression lies in its
contribution to the \textit{outcome} of a computation''~\citep{Harper_2016}.
Drawing inspiration from a wide range of literature on contextual
equivalence~\citep{morris1969lambda}, we want a context-based notion of
coherence. It is helpful to consider several examples before presenting the
formal definition of our new semantically-founded notion of coherence.

\begin{example} \label{eg:1}
The same \namee expression $1$ can be typed $[[nat]]$ in many ways: for instance, by \rref{T-lit}; by
\rref{T-sub,S-refl}; or by \rref{T-sub,S-trans,S-refl}, resulting in translations
$[[1]]$, $[[id 1]]$ and $[[ (id o id) 1 ]]$, respectively. It is apparent
that these three \tname terms are ``equal'' in the sense that all reduce to the same numeral $[[1]]$.
\end{example}

\subsection{Expression Contexts and Contextual Equivalence.}

To formalize the intuition, we turn to \textit{expression contexts}, as
introduced in \cref{sec:bg:lr}. The syntax of \tname contexts $[[cc]]$ can be found in
\cref{fig:contexts}. The static semantics of \tname is extended to expression
contexts by defining the typing judgment
\[
  [[cc : (gg |- T) ~> (gg' |- T')]]
\]
where $([[gg |- T]])$ indicates the type of the hole. This judgment is
inductively defined so that if $[[gg |- e : T]]$, then $[[gg' |- cc{e} : T']]$.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
\begin{tabular}{llll}\toprule
  \tname contexts & $[[cc]]$ & $\Coloneqq$ & $[[__]] \mid [[\x . cc]] \mid [[cc e]] \mid [[e cc]] \mid [[< cc, e >]] \mid [[< e, cc >]] \mid [[c cc]] $ \\
  \namee contexts & $[[CC]]$ & $\Coloneqq$ & $[[__]] \mid [[\x . CC]] \mid [[CC ee]] \mid [[ee CC]] \mid [[ee ,, CC]] \mid [[CC ,, ee]] \mid [[CC : A]] $ \\
  & & $\mid$ & $ [[ { l = CC } ]] \mid [[CC.l]]$ \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
  \caption{Expression contexts of \tname and \namee}
  \label{fig:contexts}
\end{figure}

We define a \textit{complete program} to mean any closed term of type $[[nat]]$.
Recall the definition of contextual equivalence in \cref{sec:bg:lr}.
For ease of reference, we restate them below:

\kleene*

Regarding \cref{eg:1}, it seems adequate to say that $3$ and $\app{[[id]]}{3}$
are contextually equivalent. Does this imply that coherence can be based on
\cref{def:cxtx}? Unfortunately it cannot, as demonstrated by the following
example.


\begin{example} \label{eg:2} It may be counter-intuitive that two \tname terms
  $[[\x . pp1 x]]$ and $[[\x . pp2 x]]$ should also be considered equal. To see
  why, first note that they are both the translations of the same \namee
  expression: $[[(\x . x) : nat & nat -> nat]]$. What can we do with this lambda
  abstraction? We can apply it to $[[1]]$ for example, which leads
  to two translations $[[  (\x . pp1 x) <1 , 1>  ]]$ and $[[ (\x . pp2 x) <1, 1>  ]]$. It is obvious that both reduce to the same numeral
  $[[1]]$. However, $[[\x . pp1 x]]$ and $[[\x . pp2 x]]$ are definitely \textit{not} equal
  according to \cref{def:cxtx}, as one can find a context
  $[[ __ <1, 2> ]]$ in which the two terms reduce to two different
  numerals. The problem is that
  % not every well-typed \tname term
  % can be obtained from a well-typed \namee expression through the
  % elaboration semantics. For example,
  $[[ __ <1, 2>  ]]$ should not be considered because the
  (non-disjoint) source expression $[[ 1 ,, 2 ]]$ is rejected by the type system
  of the source calculus \namee and thus never gets elaborated into $[[ < 1, 2>  ]]$.
\end{example}




\subsection{\namee Contexts and Refined Contextual Equivalence.}

\cref{eg:2} hints at a shift from \tname contexts to \namee contexts $[[C]]$,
whose syntax is shown in \cref{fig:contexts}. Due to the bidirectional
nature of the type system, the typing judgment of $[[C]]$ features 4
different forms:
\begin{mathpar}
  [[CC : (GG => A) ~> (GG' => A') ~~> cc]] \and
  [[CC : (GG <= A) ~> (GG' => A') ~~> cc]] \and
  [[CC : (GG => A) ~> (GG' <= A') ~~> cc]] \and
  [[CC : (GG <= A) ~> (GG' <= A') ~~> cc]]
\end{mathpar}
We write $[[CC : (GG dir A) ~> (GG' dir' A') ~~> cc]]$ to abbreviate the above 4
different forms. Take $[[CC : (GG => A) ~> (GG' => A') ~~> cc]]$ for example
(whose typing rules are shown in \cref{fig:ctyp}), it reads that if
$[[GG |- ee => A]]$, then $[[GG' |- CC{ee} => A']]$. The judgment also generates
a \tname context $[[cc]]$ so that $[[cc : (|GG| |- |A|) ~> (|GG'| |- |A'|)]]$
holds by construction. The full typing rules appear in \cref{appendix:lambdai}. Now we are
ready to refine \cref{def:cxtx}'s contextual equivalence to take into
consideration both \namee and \tname contexts.


\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \begin{small}
\drules[CTyp]{$[[CC : ( GG => A ) ~> ( GG' => B ) ~~> cc]]$}{Context typing I}{emptyOne, appLOne, appROne, mergeLOne, mergeROne, rcdOne, projOne, annoOne}
  \end{small}
\caption{\namee context typing (excerpt)}
\label{fig:ctyp}
\end{figure}



\begin{definition}[\namee Contextual Equivalence] \label{def:cxtx2}
  \begin{align*}
    [[GG |- ee1 ~= ee2 : A]]  & \defeq \forall [[e1]], [[e2]].\  [[GG |- ee1 => A ~~> e1]] \land [[GG |- ee2 => A ~~> e2]] \ \land \\
                                & \qquad (\forall [[C]], [[cc]]. \ [[CC : (GG => A) ~> (empty => nat) ~~> cc]]  \Longrightarrow \kleq{[[cc{e1}]]}{[[cc{e2}]]})
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

In other words, two source expressions are contextually equivalent if their
translations are equivalent in all possible source contexts. For brevity we only
consider expressions in the inference mode. Our Coq formalization is complete
with two modes.
Now regarding \cref{eg:2}, a possible \namee context is
\[
[[ __ 1 : (empty => nat & nat -> nat) ~> (empty => nat) ~~> __ <1 , 1>]]
\]
We can verify that both $[[\x . pp1 x]]$ and $[[\x . pp2 x]]$ produce $1$ in the context $[[__ <1 , 1>]]$.
Of course we should consider all possible contexts to be certain that they are truly equal. From now on, we
use the symbol $\backsimeq_{ctx}$ to refer to contextual equivalence in
\cref{def:cxtx2}. With \cref{def:cxtx2} we can formally state that \namee is coherent
in the following sense:

\begin{restatable}[Coherence]{theorem}{coherence} \label{thm:coherence}
  We have that
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If $[[GG |- ee => A ]]$ then $[[GG |- ee ~= ee : A]]$.
  \item If $[[GG |- ee <= A ]]$ then $[[GG |- ee ~= ee : A]]$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{restatable}

That is, coherence is just a special case of \cref{def:cxtx2} where we set
$[[ee1]]$ and $[[ee2]]$ to be the same source expression. At first glance this
is underwhelming: of course $[[ee]]$ behave the same as itself! The tricky part is
that, if we expand it according to \cref{def:cxtx2}, it is not $[[ee]]$
itself but all its translations $[[e]]$ that should behave the same!
The rest of the chapter is devoted to proving the validity of \cref{thm:coherence}.

\section{Logical Relation, Formally Defined}

Intuitive as \cref{def:cxtx2} may seem, it is generally very hard to prove
contextual equivalence directly, since it involves quantification over
\textit{all} possible contexts. Worse still, two kinds of contexts are involved
in \cref{thm:coherence}, which makes reasoning even more tedious. The key to
simplifying the reasoning is to exploit types using logical
relations~\citep{tait, statman1985logical, plotkin1973lambda}.

It is worth pausing to ponder what kind of relation we are looking for. % From
% \cref{eg:2}, it is clear that pairs have a special status in \tname. Indeed they
% ought to be, since pairs originate from merges or subtyping. Also disjointness
% on intersection types should correspond to some sort of constraints over pairs.
The high-level intuition behind the relation is to capture the notion of
``coherent'' values. These values are unambiguous in all possible (source)
contexts. A moment of thought leads us to the following observations:

\begin{observation}[Disjoint values are unambiguous] \label{ob:1}

  The relation should relate values originating from disjoint intersection
  types. Those values are essentially translated from merges, and since
  \rref{T-merge} ensures disjointness, they are unambiguous. For example, two
  values of types $[[nat]]$ and $[[ { l : nat}]]$ can always be distinguished by
  any source context.
\end{observation}

\begin{observation}[Duplication is unambiguous] \label{ob:2}

  The relation should also relate values originating from non-disjoint intersection
  types, only if the values are duplicates. This may sound baffling, since the
  whole point of disjointness is to rule out (ambiguous) expressions such as
  $[[ 1 ,, 2   ]]$. However, $[[ 1,, 2 ]]$ never gets elaborated, and the only values
  corresponding to $[[nat & nat]]$ are those pairs such as $[[ <1 , 1>   ]]$,
  $[[ <2 , 2>   ]]$, etc. Those values are essentially generated from \rref{T-sub} by subtyping
  and are also unambiguous.
\end{observation}

\paragraph{Canonicity.}

In order to deal with the complexity of the elaboration semantics, we introduce
in \cref{fig:logical} what we call \textit{canonicity} to capture ``canonical''
values based on the above observations. Canonicity is a family of binary
relations over \tname values that are \textit{heterogeneous}, i.e., indexed by
two \namee types. Heterogeneity allows us to relate values of different types,
and in particular values of disjoint types. Canonicity seeks to combine equality
checking from traditional (homogeneous) logical relations (\cref{ob:2}) with
disjointness checking (\cref{ob:1}). It consists of two relations. The
value relation $\valR{[[A]]}{[[B]]}$ relates \textit{closed} values, i.e.,
well-typed values with no free variables. Similarly, the expression relation
$\eeR{[[A]]}{[[B]]}$ relates closed expressions. For brevity, we write
$\valRR{[[A]]}$ to mean $\valR{[[A]]}{[[A]]}$, and $\eeRR{[[A]]}$ for
$\eeR{[[A]]}{[[A]]}$.

% \begin{remark}
%   The logical relations resemble those given by Biernacki and
%   Polesiuk~\citep{biernacki2015logical}, as both are heterogeneous. However, two
%   important differences are worth pointing out. Firstly, our value relation for
%   product types ($\valR{[[T1 * T2]]}{[[T3]]}$ and $\valR{[[T3]]}{[[T1 * T2]]}$)
%   is unusual. Secondly, their value relation disallows relating functions with
%   natural numbers, while ours does not. As we explain shortly, both points are
%   related to disjointness.
% \end{remark}



First let us consider the relation $\valR{[[A]]}{[[B]]}$, which specifies when
two closed values $[[v1]]$ and $[[v2]]$ are related at the types $[[A]]$ and
$[[B]]$. The definition for integers and records are straightforward. Two
integers are related if they are equal. For records, recall that in
\cref{sec:elaboration}, record labels are erased during translation. Therefore
two values are related at two record types of the same label if they are related
at the two field types.

Functions $[[v1]]$ and $[[v2]]$ are related at the types $[[A1 -> B1]]$ and
$[[A2 -> B2]]$ if given two arguments $[[v1']]$ and $[[v2']]$ related at the
argument types $[[A1]]$ and $[[A2]]$, the functions applied to the arguments are
related expressions at the result types $[[B1]]$ and $[[B2]]$. Note that in
\tname, the values $[[v1]]$ and $[[v2]]$ may each be a lambda abstraction, or a
coercion application of a function type.

% Two functions are related if they map
% related arguments to related results.  These
% cases reflect \cref{ob:2}: values of the same type are duplicates.


The definition of $\valR{[[A]]}{[[B]]}$ is made more interesting when one of the
indexed types is an intersection type. In that case, the relation distributes
over the type constructor $[[&]]$. It is instructive to compare the type constructor $[[&]]$ with product
types $[[*]]$. The traditional way of relating pairs is by relating their components
pairwise. That is, $[[<v1,v2>]]$ and $[[<v1', v2'>]]$ are related at $[[ A * B  ]]$ if (1)
$[[v1]]$ and $[[v1']]$ are related at $[[A]]$ and (2) $[[v2]]$ and $[[v2']]$ are related at $[[B]]$.
According to our definition, we also require that (3) $[[v1]]$ and $[[v2']]$ are
related and (4) $[[v2]]$ and $[[v1']]$ are related. To see why this is the case, consider
whether $(\pair{1}{2}, \pair{1}{2}) \in \valRR{[[nat & nat]]}$. If we regard
$[[nat & nat]]$ as a normal product type, then these two pairs are related.
However, as we mentioned, $\pair{1}{2}$ should not be considered as the image of
some source expression at the type $[[nat & nat]]$, and our definition correctly
rejects it because $1$ is not equal to $2$, while accepting pairs such as
$\pair{1}{1}, \pair{2}{2}$, etc.

The acute reader may have noticed the structural similarity between the two
clauses for intersection types and the disjointness rules for intersection types:
\begin{mathpar}
 \drule{D-andL} \and \drule{D-andR}
\end{mathpar}
This is not a coincidence---we can show that disjointness and the value relation
are connected by the following lemma:

\begin{lemma}[Disjoint values are related] \label{lemma:disjoint}
  If $[[A ** B]]$ and $[[  v1 : |A|  ]]$ and
  $[[  v2 : |B|  ]]$,
  then $[[   (v1, v2) in V ( A ; B  )    ]]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on the derivation of disjointness.
\end{proof}

Next we consider $\eeR{[[A]]}{[[B]]}$, which is standard. Informally it
expresses that two closed terms $[[e1]]$ and $[[e2]]$ are related if
they evaluate to two values $[[v1]]$ and $[[v2]]$ that are related.



\paragraph{Logical Equivalence.}

The logical relation can be lifted to open terms in the usual way. First we give
the semantic interpretation of typing contexts. A \textit{closing substitution}
$[[ g ]]$ for the typing context $ [[GG]] = [[x1]] : [[A1]], \dots , [[xn]] :
[[An]] $ is a finite function assigning closed values
$[[ v1 ]] : [[ |A1|]], \dots , [[vn]] : [[ |An| ]]$ to $[[ x1 ]] , \dots , [[xn]]$, respectively.
We write $[[ g(e) ]]$ for the substitution $[  [[v1]], \dots, [[vn]]  / [[x1]], \dots, [[xn]]   ] [[e]]  $.
The interruption of typing contexts, written $[[  (g1, g2) in GG ]]$ is inductively defined as follows:

\begin{definition}[Interpretation of value contexts]
  \begin{mathpar}
    \ottaltinferrule{}{}{  }{ [[(emp, emp) in empty ]]  } \and
    \ottaltinferrule{}{}{ [[(g1, g2) in GG  ]] \\ [[(v1, v2) in V (A) ]] }{ [[(g1 [ x -> v1 ] , g2 [ x -> v2 ]  )  in GG , x : A  ]] }
  \end{mathpar}
\end{definition}

Two open terms are related if every pair of related closing substitutions
makes them related:
\begin{definition}[Logical equivalence]
  \begin{align*}
    [[GG |- e1 == e2 : A ; B]] & \defeq [[|GG| |- e1 : |A|]] \land [[|GG| |- e2 : | B | ]] \ \land \\
                                 & \qquad (\forall [[g1]], [[g2]] .\, [[(g1, g2) in GG ]] \Longrightarrow [[(g1 (e1), g2 (e2))  in E (A ; B) ]])
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}
For succinctness, we write $[[GG |- e1 == e2 : A]]$ to mean $[[GG |- e1 == e2 : A ; A]]$.


\section{Establishing Coherence}

With all the machinery in place, we are now ready to prove \cref{thm:coherence}.
But we need several lemmas to set the stage.

Firstly we need the compatibility lemmas, which state that logical equivalence is
preserved by language constructs. Most of them are standard and are thus omitted.
We show only two compatibility lemmas that are specific to our logical relation:

\begin{lemma}[Coercion Compatibility]   \label{lemma:co-compa}
  Suppose that $[[A1 <: A2 ~~> c]]$,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If $[[GG |- e1 == e2 : A1 ; A0]]$ then $[[GG |- c e1 == e2 : A2 ; A0]]$.
  \item If $[[GG |- e1 == e2 : A0 ; A1]]$ then $[[GG |- e1 == c e2 : A0 ; A2]]$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on the subtyping derivation.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Merge compatibility]
  If $[[   GG |- e1 == e1' : A ]]$, $[[  GG |- e2 == e2' : B ]]$ and $[[ A ** B ]]$,
  then $[[   GG |- < e1, e2 > == <e1', e2'> : A & B ]]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By the definition of logical relation and \cref{lemma:disjoint}.
\end{proof}



The ``Fundamental Property'' states that any well-typed expression is related to
itself by the logical relation. In our elaboration setting, we rephrase it so
that any two \tname terms elaborated from the \textit{same} \namee expression are related
by the logical relation. To prove it, we require \cref{thm:uniq}.

\begin{theorem}[Inference Uniqueness] \label{thm:uniq}
  If $[[GG |- ee => A1]]$ and $[[GG |- ee => A2]]$, then $[[A1]] \equiv [[A2]]$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Fundamental Property]  \label{thm:co-log} We have that:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If $[[GG |- ee => A ~~> e]]$ and $[[GG |- ee => A ~~> e']]$, then $[[GG |- e == e' : A ]]$.
  \item If $[[GG |- ee <= A ~~> e]]$ and $[[GG |- ee <= A ~~> e']]$, then $[[GG |- e == e' : A ]]$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  The proof follows by induction on the first derivation. The most interesting
  case is \rref{T-sub}
  \begin{mathpar}
    \drule{T-sub}
  \end{mathpar}
  where we need \cref{thm:uniq} to be able to apply the induction hypothesis.
  Then we apply \cref{lemma:co-compa} to say that the coercion generated
  preserves the relation between terms. For the other cases we use the
  appropriate compatibility lemmas.
\end{proof}


We show that logical equivalence is preserved by \namee contexts:

\begin{lemma}[Congruence] \label{lemma:cong}
 If $[[CC : (GG dir A) ~> (GG' dir' A') ~~> cc]]$, $[[GG |- ee1 dir A ~~> e1]]$, $[[GG |- ee2 dir A ~~> e2]]$
 and $[[GG |- e1 == e2 : A]]$, then $[[GG' |- cc{e1} == cc{e2} : A']]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on the typing derivation of the context $[[C]]$, and applying
  the compatibility lemmas where appropriate.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}[Adequacy] \label{lemma:ade}
  If $[[  empty |- e1 == e2 : nat ]]$ then $\kleq{[[e1]]}{[[e2]]}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Adequacy follows easily from the definition of the logical relation.
\end{proof}


Next up is the proof that logical relation is sound with respect to contextual
equivalence---that is, if two programs are logically related then they are
contextually equivalent---which justifies the use of logical relation for
proving contextual equivalence of programs.

\begin{theorem}[Soundness w.r.t. Contextual Equivalence] \label{thm:log-sound}
  Given $[[GG |- e1 == e2 : A]]$, we have
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If $[[ GG |- ee1 => A ~~> e1]]$ and $[[ GG |- ee2 => A ~~> e2]]$ then
    $[[ GG |- ee1 ~= ee2 : A ]]$.
  \item If $[[ GG |- ee1 <= A ~~> e1]]$ and $[[ GG |- ee2 <= A ~~> e2]]$ then
    $[[ GG |- ee1 ~= ee2 : A ]]$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  From \cref{def:cxtx2}, we are given a context $[[  CC : (GG => A) ~> (empty => nat) ~~> cc ]]$. By \cref{lemma:cong}
  we have $[[  empty |- cc{e1} == cc{e2} : nat  ]]$, thus $  \kleq{[[ cc{e1} ]]}{ [[cc{e2} ]]}    $ by \cref{lemma:ade}.
\end{proof}


Armed with \cref{thm:co-log} and \cref{thm:log-sound}, coherence follows directly.
\coherence*
\begin{proof}
  Immediate from \cref{thm:co-log} and \cref{thm:log-sound}.
\end{proof}

\section{Some Interesting Corollaries}

To showcase the strength of the new proof method, we can derive some
interesting corollaries. For the most part, they are direct consequences of
logical equivalence which carry over to contextual equivalence.


\cref{lemma:neutral} says that merging an expression $[[ee1]]$ of some type with
an arbitrary expression $[[ee2]]$ does not affect the semantics of $[[ee1]]$ at
the same type. \cref{lemma:commu} and \cref{lemma:assoc} express that merges are
commutative and associative, respectively. \cref{lemma:coercion_same} states
that coercions from the same types are ``coherent'', i.e., they can be used
interchangeably.

\begin{corollary}[Neutrality] \label{lemma:neutral}
  If $[[GG |- ee1 => A ]]$ and $[[GG |- ee1 ,, ee2 => A ]]$, then
  $[[GG |- ee1 ~= ee1 ,, ee2 : A]]$
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}[Commutativity] \label{lemma:commu}
  If $[[GG |- ee1 ,, ee2 => A ]]$ and $[[GG |- ee2 ,, ee1 => A ]]$, then
  $[[GG |- ee1 ,, ee2 ~= ee2 ,, ee1 : A]]$.
\end{corollary}


\begin{corollary}[Associativity] \label{lemma:assoc}
  If $[[GG |- (ee1 ,, ee2) ,, ee3 => A  ]]$ and $[[GG |- ee1 ,, (ee2 ,, ee3) => A ]]$, then
  $[[GG |- (ee1 ,, ee2) ,, ee3 ~= ee1 ,, (ee2 ,, ee3) : A]]$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}[Coercions Preserve Semantics]
  \label{lemma:coercion_same}
  If $[[A <: B ~~> c1]]$ and $[[A <: B ~~> c2]]$, then $[[GG |- \x . c1 x == \x . c2 x :  A  ->  B ]]$.
\end{corollary}
