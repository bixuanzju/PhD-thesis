\chapter{Semantics of the \namee Calculus}
\label{chap:nested}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This chapter presents \namee, a calculus with disjoint intersection types that
features both BCD-style subtyping and the merge operator, which we believe
capture the essence of nested composition. We illustrate this by showing a neat
solution to the Expression Problem based on family polymorphism. We then discuss
the algorithmic aspects of \namee. The coherence property of \namee is discussed
in \cref{chap:coherence:simple}.
