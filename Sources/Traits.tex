In this chapter and \cref{chap:case_study}, we present two applications of
\fnamee. This chapter is concerned with building a source-level language named
\sedel that features \textit{typed first-class traits}. In particular we show
how to model source-level constructs for first-class traits and dynamic
inheritance, supporting standard object-oriented features such as dynamic
dispatching and abstract methods. It is remarkable that all of these can be
explained by plain \fnamee expressions, showing its supreme expressive power.
In \cref{chap:case_study} we conduct a case study of modularizing programming
language features by the means of first-class traits.
