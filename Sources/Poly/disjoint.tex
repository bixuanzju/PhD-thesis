In this section we present the formal rules for disjointness. As show in
\cref{fig:disjoint:fi}, the disjointness rules of \fnamee are directly inherited
from \fname, which consists of two judgments.


\paragraph{Main judgment.}

The main judgment $[[DD |- A ** B]]$ says that the two types $[[A]]$ and $[[B]]$
are disjoint in the context $[[DD]]$. As a precondition, we require the two types $[[A]]$
and $[[B]]$ are both well-formed in the context $[[DD]]$.
Most of the rules are similar to those of
\namee. The major additions are the two rules (\rref*{FD-tvarL,FD-tvarR}) for
type variables, and \rref{FD-forall} for disjoint quantification.
\Rref{FD-tvarL} and its symmetric one \rref*{FD-tvarR} both state that a type
variable $[[X]]$ is disjoint with some type $[[B]]$ if and only if the
disjointness constraint of $[[X]]$ in the context $[[DD]]$ is a subtype of
$[[B]]$. These two rules are a specialization of a more general lemma, which
says that disjointness is covariant with respect to subtyping. In a more precise
sense, we have the following:

\begin{lemma}[Covariance of disjointness] \label{lemma:covariance:disjoint}
  If $[[DD |- A ** B]]$ and $[[B <: C]]$, then $[[DD |- A ** C]]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By double induction, first on the subtyping derivation, and then on the
  type $[[A]]$. In the case for \rref{FS-forall}, we need \cref{lemma:narrow:disjoint}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Narrowing of disjointness] \label{lemma:narrow:disjoint}
  If $[[DD, X ** C1 |- A ** B]]$ and $[[C2 <: C1]]$, then $[[DD, X ** C2 |- A ** B]]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We need to slightly generalize the lemma in the sense that the type variable is inserted
  in the middle, then by induction on the disjointness derivation.
\end{proof}

An intuition of the following may help better understanding
\cref{lemma:covariance:disjoint}. As we will see in \cref{sec:category}, another
way to interpret disjointness of two types is that their least upper bound is
(isomorphic to) $[[Top]]$. Following this interpretation, it is obvious that if
the least upper bound of two given types is already $[[Top]]$, a supertype of
one of them will not change this fact.

Let us now turn to \rref{FD-forall}. To illustrate this rule, consider the following two types:
\begin{mathpar}
  [[ \X ** nat . X & nat ]] \and  [[ \X ** char . X & char ]]
\end{mathpar}
Under what conditions are the two types disjoint? In the first type, $[[X]]$
cannot be instantiated to $[[nat]]$ (among others) and in the second type
$[[X]]$ cannot be instantiated to $[[char]]$. Therefore for both bodies to be disjoint,
$[[X]]$ can only be instantiated to types that are disjoint with both $[[nat]]$
and $[[char]]$. More formally, in \rref{FD-forall}, we add a new
constraint by intersecting the two constraints to the context and check for disjointness
in the extended context.

\paragraph{Disjointness axioms.}

Disjointness axioms $[[ A **a B ]]$  take care of two types with different type constructs,
except for when one of them is $[[Top]]$, an intersection type or a type
variable, which are all dealt with by the main judgment.

To conclude this section, we show that disjointness is symmetric:

\begin{lemma}[Symmetry of disjointness]
  If $[[ DD |- A ** B  ]]$, then $[[  DD |- B ** A   ]]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on the disjointness derivation. In the case for \rref{FD-forall},
  apply \cref{lemma:narrow:disjoint}.
\end{proof}
