\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:poly:motivation}

Parametric polymorphism~\citep{reynolds1983types} is a well-beloved (and
well-studied) programming feature. It enables a single piece of code to be
reused on data of different types. So it is quite natural and theoretically
interesting to study combining parametric polymorphism with disjoint
intersection types, especially how it affects disjointness and coherence. On a
more pragmatic note, the combination of parametric polymorphism and disjoint
intersection types also reveals new insights into practical applications.
Dynamically-typed languages (such as JavaScript) usually embrace quite flexible
mechanisms for class/object composition, e.g., mixin composition where objects
can be composed at run time, and their structures are not necessarily statically
known. The use of intersection types in TypeScript is inspired by such flexible
programming patterns. For example, an important use of intersection types in
TypeScript is the following function for mixin composition:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
function extend<T, U>(first: T, second : U) : T & U {...}
\end{lstlisting}
which is analogous to our merge operator in that it takes two objects and
produces an object with the intersection of the types of the argument objects.
However, the types of the two objects are not known, i.e., they are generic. An
important point is that, while it is possible to define such function in
TypeScript (albeit using some low-level (and type-unsafe) features of
JavaScript), it can also cause, as pointed out by \citet{alpuimdisjoint},
run-time type errors! Clearly a well-defined meaning for intersection types with
type variables is needed.


\paragraph{Disjoint Polymorphism.}

Motivated by the above two points, \citet{alpuimdisjoint} proposed disjoint
polymorphism, a variant of parametric polymorphism. The main novelty is
\textit{disjoint (universal) quantification} of the form $[[ \ X ** A . B ]]$.
Inspired by bounded quantification~\citep{cardelli1994extension} where a type
variable is constrained by a type bound, disjoint quantification allows type
variables to be associated with \textit{disjointness constraints}.
Correspondingly, a term construct of the form $[[ \ X ** A. ee ]]$ is used to
create values of disjoint quantification. We have seen some examples of disjoint
polymorphism at work in \cref{bg:sec:disjoint_poly}. With disjointness constraints
and a built-in merge operator, a type-safe and conflict-free \lstinline{extend}
function can be naturally defined as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
extend T [U * T] (first : T) (second : U) : T & U = first ,, second;
\end{lstlisting}
The disjointness constraint on the type variable \lstinline{U} ensures that no
conflicts can occur when composing two objects, which is quite similar to
trait-based approach~\citep{scharli2003traits} in object-orientated programming.
We shall devote a whole chapter (\cref{chap:traits}) to further this point.


\paragraph{Adding BCD Subtyping.}

While \citet{alpuimdisjoint} studied the combination of disjoint intersection
types and parametric polymorphism, they follow the then-standard approach
of \citet{oliveira2016disjoint} to ensure coherence, thus excluding the
possibility of adding BCD subtyping. The combination of BCD subtyping and
disjoint polymorphism opens doors for more expressiveness. For example, we can
define the following function
\begin{lstlisting}
combine A [B * A] (f : {foo : Int -> A})
                  (g : {foo : Int -> B}) : {foo : Int -> A & B} = f ,, g;
\end{lstlisting}
which ``combines'' two singleton records with parts of types unknown and returns
another singleton record containing an intersection type. A variant of this
function plays a fundamental role in defining Object Algebra combinators (cf.
\cref{chap:case_study}).




In what follows, we first present the syntax and semantics (subtyping and
typing) of \fnamee. We then discuss the disjointness judgment in detail, in
particular, the disjointness relation between type variables and arbitrary
types. Finally we talk about the elaboration semantics of \fnamee and its target
calculus \tnamee, a variant of System F with explicit coercions.
