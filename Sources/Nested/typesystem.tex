\section{Syntax and Semantics of the Source}
\label{sec:typesystem}

In this section we formally present the syntax and semantics of \namee. Compared
to prior work~\citep{alpuimdisjoint, oliveira2016disjoint}, \namee has a more
powerful subtyping relation. The new subtyping relation is inspired by BCD-style
subtyping, but with two noteworthy differences: subtyping is coercive (in
contrast to traditional formulations of BCD); and it is extended with records.
We also have a new target language with explicit coercions inspired by the coercion calculus of
\citet{Henglein_1994}. A full technical comparison between \namee and \oname can be found in \cref{sec:comparision}.


\subsection{Syntax}

\Cref{fig:source} shows the syntax of \namee.
% with the differences from \oname \hll{highlighted}.
% \namee is a simple calculus with intersection types, the merge operator
% and singleton records.
For brevity of the meta-theoretic study, we do not
consider primitive operations on integers, or other primitive types.
They can be easily added to the language, and our prototype implementation is
indeed equipped with common primitive types and their operations.
Metavariables $[[A]], [[B]], [[C]]$ range over types. Types include the type of integers
$[[nat]]$, a top type $[[Top]]$, function types $[[A -> B]]$, intersection types
$[[A & B]]$, and singleton record types $[[ {l : A} ]]$. Metavariable $[[ee]]$
ranges over expressions. Expressions include variables $[[x]]$, integers $[[i]]$,
a canonical top value $[[Top]]$, lambda abstractions $[[\x . ee]]$,
applications $[[ee1 ee2]]$, merges $[[ee1 ,, ee2]]$, annotated terms $[[ee : A]]$,
singleton records $[[ {l = ee}]]$, and record selections $[[ee.l ]]$.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
\begin{tabular}{llll}\toprule
  Types & $[[A]], [[B]], [[C]]$ & $\Coloneqq$ & $[[nat]] \mid [[Top]] \mid [[A -> B]]  \mid [[A & B]] \mid [[ { l : A } ]]$ \\
  Expressions & $[[ee]]$ & $\Coloneqq$ & $[[x]] \mid [[i]] \mid [[Top]] \mid [[\x . ee]] \mid [[ee1 ee2]] \mid [[ee1 ,, ee2]] \mid [[ee : A]]  $ \\
  & & $\mid$ & $ [[ { l = ee } ]] \mid [[ee.l]] $ \\
  Typing contexts & $[[GG]]$ & $\Coloneqq$ & $[[empty]] \mid [[GG , x : A]]$ \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
  \caption{Syntax of \namee}
  \label{fig:source}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Declarative Subtyping}

\Cref{fig:subtype_decl} presents the subtyping relation. We ignore the
\hll{highlighted} parts, and explain them later in \cref{sec:elaboration}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \drules[S]{$[[A <: B ~~> c]]$}{Declarative subtyping}{refl, trans, top, rcd, arr, andl, andr, and, distArr, topArr, distRcd, topRcd}
  \caption{Declarative specification of subtyping}
  \label{fig:subtype_decl}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{BCD-Style Subtyping.}
The subtyping rules are essentially those of the BCD type
system~\citep{Barendregt_1983}, extended with subtyping for singleton records.
\Rref{S-top,S-rcd} for top types and record types are straightforward.
\Rref{S-arr} for function subtyping is standard. \Rref{S-andl,S-andr,S-and} for
intersection types axiomatize that $[[A & B]]$ is the greatest lower bound of
$[[A]]$ and $[[B]]$. \Rref{S-distArr} is perhaps the most interesting rule.
This, so-called ``distributivity'' rule, describes the interaction between
the subtyping relations for function types and those for intersection types.
Note that the other direction $[[A1 -> A2 & A3 <: (A1 -> A2) & (A1 -> A3)]]$
and the contravariant distribution $[[ (A1 -> A2) & (A3 -> A2) <: A1 & A3 -> A2 ]]$ are both
derivable from the existing subtyping rules, as shown below:
  \begin{footnotesize}
\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule*[right=\rref*{S-and}]
  {  \inferrule*[right=\rref*{S-arr}]{ [[ A1 <: A1  ]] \\ [[ A2 & A3 <: A2  ]]  }{[[   A1 -> A2 & A3 <: A1 -> A2  ]]} \\
    \inferrule*[right=\rref*{S-arr}]{ [[ A1 <: A1  ]] \\ [[ A2 & A3 <: A3  ]] }{[[ A1 -> A2 & A3 -> A1 -> A3      ]]}  }
  {  [[ A1 -> A2 & A3 <: (A1 -> A2) & (A1 -> A3)  ]]  }
\end{mathpar}
\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule*[right=\rref*{S-trans}]
  {  \inferrule*[right=\rref*{S-andl}]{ }{[[ (A1 -> A2) & (A3 -> A2) <: A1 -> A2   ]]} \\
    \inferrule*[right=\rref*{S-arr}]{ [[ A1 & A3 <: A1  ]] \\ [[ A2 <: A2  ]] }{[[ A1 -> A2 <: A1 & A3 -> A2  ]]}  }
  {  [[  (A1 -> A2) & (A3 -> A2) <: A1 & A3 -> A2  ]]   }
\end{mathpar}
  \end{footnotesize}
\Rref{S-distRcd}, which is not found in the original BCD system,
prescribes the distribution of records over intersection types. The two
distributivity rules are the key to enable nested composition. \Rref*{S-topArr} is standard in BCD subtyping, and the new
\rref{S-topRcd} plays a similar role for record types.

\paragraph{Non-Algorithmic.}
The subtyping relation in \cref{fig:subtype_decl} is clearly no more than a
specification due to the two subtyping axioms: \rref{S-refl,S-trans}. A sound
and complete algorithmic version is discussed in \cref{sec:alg}. Nevertheless,
for the sake of establishing coherence, the declarative subtyping relation is
sufficient.


\paragraph{Property of Subtyping.}
The subtyping relation is vacuously \textit{reflexive} and \textit{transitive}.



\subsection{Typing of \namee}

\end{figure}

% no gray anymore after this point
\renewcommand{\rulehl}[1]{#1}



The bidirectional type system for \namee is shown in \cref{fig:type_system}.
Again we ignore the \hll{highlighted} parts for now.

% The main difference to \oname is the absence of a well-formedness
% judgment. Unlike \oname, which requires a well-formedness judgment to ensure
% that all intersection types are disjoint, \namee only requires a disjointness
% check at the merge operator. Non-disjoint types such as $[[nat & nat]]$ are
% allowed in other parts of the program.

\begin{comment}
Unlike the development of \oname, which first presents a type assignment
specification, \Cref{fig:type_system} directly present the bidirectional type
system of \namee.
Unfortunately, we found that their declarative type
system is incoherent in nature (even with all the syntactic restrictions).
\jeremy{perhaps add a counter example somewhere?} Again, the reader is advised
to continue ignoring the gray-shaded parts until \cref{sec:elaboration}.
\tom{The above story is a bit confusing to me. Is it the case that the
     \oname paper already was aware of the coherence problem with its
     declarative type system and for that reason (and inference) presented
     a bidirection type system as well? If so, that's not clear.} \jeremy{I
     remember at one point Bruno and I believed the declarative system is
     coherent, it's just hard to prove. Then I found a counterexample. That was
     after \tname paper.  }

  \caption{Disjointness}
  \label{fig:disjoint}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Typing Rules and Disjointness.}

As with traditional bidirectional type systems, we employ two modes: the
inference mode ($[[=>]]$) and the checking mode ($[[<=]]$). The inference
judgment $[[GG |- ee => A]]$ says that we can synthesize a type $[[A]]$ for
expression $[[ee]]$ in the context $[[GG]]$. The checking judgment $[[GG |- ee
<= A]]$ checks $[[ee]]$ against $[[A]]$ in the context $[[GG]]$. The
disjointness judgment $[[A ** B]]$ used in \rref{T-merge} is shown in
\cref{fig:disjoint}, which states that the types $[[A]]$ and $[[B]]$ are
\textit{disjoint}. The intuition of two types being disjoint is
that their least upper bound is (isomorphic to) $[[Top]]$. The disjointness judgment is
important in order to rule out ambiguous expressions such as $\mer{1}{2}$. Most
of the typing and disjointness rules are standard and are explained in detail in
previous work~\citep{oliveira2016disjoint, alpuimdisjoint}.
%We refer
%the reader to their papers for further explanation.



\section{Syntax and Semantics of the Target}
\label{sec:elaboration}

\end{tabular}
  \caption{\tname syntax}
  \label{fig:target}
\end{figure}

The dynamic semantics of \namee is given by elaborating source expressions
$[[ee]]$ into target terms $[[e]]$. Our target language \tname is the standard
simply-typed call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus extended with products and
coercions. The syntax of \tname is shown in \cref{fig:target}. The meta-function
$| \cdot |$ shown in \cref{def:type:translate} transforms \namee types to \tname
types. It is worth pointing out that we use the erasure semantics to model
record labels, i.e., labels are erased during elaboration. It is equally fine to
keep labels in the target. The notation $| \cdot |$ is also overloaded for
context translation from \namee contexts $[[GG]]$ to \tname contexts $[[gg]]$.

\begin{definition}[Type translation from \namee to \tname] \label{def:type:translate}
  \begin{align*}
    | [[nat]] | &= [[nat]] \\
    | [[Top]] | &= \langle \rangle \\
    | [[A -> B]]  | &= [[ | A | -> | B |  ]] \\
    | [[ A & B  ]] | &= [[ | A | * | B |  ]] \\
    | \recordType{l}{A} | &= | A |
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}



\subsection{Explicit Coercions and Coercive Subtyping}

The separate syntactic category for explicit coercions is a distinct
difference from the prior works (in which they are regular terms). Our coercions
are based on those of \citet{Henglein_1994}, and we add more forms due to our
extra subtyping rules.
Metavariable $[[c]]$ ranges over coercions.\footnote{Coercions $[[pp1]]$ and $[[pp2]]$ subsume the first and second projection of pairs, respectively.}
Coercions express the conversion
of a term from one type to another. Because of the addition of coercions, the
grammar contains explicit coercion applications $[[c e]]$ as a term, and various
unsaturated coercion applications as values. The use of explicit coercions is useful for the new semantic
proof of coherence based on logical relations.
The subtyping judgment in \cref{fig:subtype_decl} has the form $[[A <: B ~~> c]]$, which says that the
subtyping derivation of $[[A <: B]]$ produces a coercion $[[c]]$ that converts
terms of type $[[ |A| ]]$ to type $[[ |B| ]]$. Each subtyping rule has its own
specific form of coercion.

%The meaning of the different forms of coercions becomes clear in \tom{Section
%  TODO} \jeremy{it's a paragraph, how to refer it?} which explains coercive
%subtyping.\bruno{Why not discuss the form of coercions directly here?}


\subsection{Typing of \tname}

The typing of \tname has the form $[[gg |- e : T]]$, which is entirely standard. Only the typing of coercion
applications, shown below, deserves attention:
\begin{mathpar}
\drule{t-capp}
\end{mathpar}
Here the judgment $[[c |- T1 tri T2]]$ expresses the typing of coercions, which
are essentially functions from $[[T1]]$ to $[[T2]]$. Their typing
rules correspond exactly to the subtyping rules of \namee, as
shown in \cref{fig:co}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \drules[ct]{$[[c |- T1 tri T2]]$}{Coercion typing}{refl, trans, top, topArr, arr, pair, projl, projr, distArr}
  \caption{Coercion typing}
  \label{fig:co}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Dynamic Semantics}

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
\drules[r]{$[[e --> e']]$}{Single-step reduction}{id, trans, top, topArr, pair, arr, distArr, projl, projr, app, ctxt}
  \caption{Dynamic semantics of \tname}
  \label{fig:coercion_red}
\end{figure}

The dynamic semantics of \tname is shown in \cref{fig:coercion_red}. We write
$[[e --> e']]$ for reduction of expressions. The first three lines are reduction
rules for coercions. They do not contribute to computation but merely rearrange
coercions. Our coercion reduction rules are quite standard but not efficient in
terms of space. Nevertheless, there is existing work on space-efficient
coercions~\citep{Siek_2015, herman2010space}, which should be applicable to our
work as well. \Rref{r-app} is the usual $\beta$-rule that performs actual
computation, and \rref{r-ctxt} handles reduction under an evaluation context. As
standard, $[[-->>]]$ is the reflexive, transitive closure of $[[-->]]$.
Now we can show that \tname is type safe:
\begin{theorem}[Preservation]
  If $[[empty |- e : T]]$ and $[[e --> e']]$, then $[[empty |- e' : T]]$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Progress]
  If $[[empty |- e : T]]$, then either $[[e]]$ is a value, or there exists $[[e']]$ such
  that $[[e --> e']]$.
\end{theorem}


\subsection{Elaboration Semantics}

\begin{comment}
The subtyping judgment in \cref{fig:subtype_decl} has the form $[[A <: B ~~> c]]$, which says that the subtyping
derivation of $[[A <: B]]$ produces a coercion $[[c]]$ that is used to convert a
term of type $[[ |A| ]]$ to type $[[ |B| ]]$. Each
subtyping rule has its own specific form of coercion.
\end{comment}
We are now in a position to explain the elaboration judgments $[[GG |- ee
=> A ~~> e]]$ and $[[GG |- ee <= A ~~> e]]$ in \cref{fig:type_system}. The only
interesting rule is \rref{T-sub}, which applies the coercion $[[c]]$ produced by
subtyping to the target term $[[e]]$ to form a coercion application
$[[c e]]$. All the other rules do straightforward translations between
source and target expressions.


To conclude, we show two lemmas that relate \namee expressions
to \tname terms.
% (Note that in this and subsequent sections, we only provide
% a proof sketch for each lemma and theorem. We refer the interested reader
% to our Coq development for the full proofs.)

\begin{lemma}[Coercions preserve types]
  If $[[A <: B ~~> c]]$, then $[[c |-  |A| tri |B|]]$.
  \label{lemma:sub-correct}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By structural induction on the derivation of subtyping.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}[Elaboration soundness] We have that:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If $[[GG |- ee => A ~~> e]]$, then $|\Gamma| \vdash e : |A| $.
  \item If $[[GG |- ee <= A ~~> e]]$, then $|\Gamma| \vdash e : |A| $.
  \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By structural induction on the derivation of typing.
\end{proof}

\section{Comparison with \oname}
\label{sec:comparision}

In this section we identify major differences from \oname, which, when
taken together, yield a simpler and more elegant system. The differences may seem
superficial, but they have far-reaching impacts on the semantics, especially on
coherence, our major topic in \cref{chap:coherence:simple}.

\paragraph{No Ordinary Types.}

Apart from the extra subtyping rules, there is an important difference from the
\oname subtyping relation. The subtyping relation of \oname employs an
auxiliary unary relation called $\mathsf{ordinary}$, which plays a fundamental
role for ensuring coherence and obtaining an
algorithm~\citep{Davies_2000}. The \namee calculus discards the notion of
ordinary types completely; this yields a clean and elegant formulation of the
subtyping relation. Another minor difference is that due to the addition of the
transitivity axiom (\rref{S-trans}), \rref{S-andl,S-andr} are simplified: an
intersection type $[[A & B]]$ is a subtype of both $[[A]]$ and $[[B]]$, instead
of the more general form $[[ A & B <: C]]$.

% \paragraph{Example}
% The following example shows the derivation tree of the subtyping example
% presented in \cref{sec:overview}. \jeremy{A derivation of the nested composition
%   example? }


\paragraph{No Top-Like Types.}

There is a notable difference from the coercive subtyping of \oname. Because of
their syntactic proof method, they have special treatment for coercions of
\textit{top-like types} in order to retain coherence. For \namee, as
with ordinary types, we do not need this kind of ad-hoc treatment, thanks to the
adoption of a more powerful proof method (cf. \cref{chap:coherence:simple}).




\paragraph{No Well-Formedness Judgment.}

A key difference from the type system of \oname is the complete omission of the
well-formedness judgment. In \oname, the well-formedness judgment $[[GG |- A]]$
appears in both \rref{T-abs,T-sub}. The sole purpose of this judgment is
to enforce that all intersection types are disjoint. However, as
\cref{chap:coherence:simple} will explain, the syntactic restriction is unnecessary for
coherence, and merely complicates the type system. The \namee calculus discards
this well-formedness judgment altogether in favour of a simpler design that is
still coherent. An important implication is that even without adding BCD subtyping,
\namee is already more expressive than \oname: an expression such as $1 : [[nat & nat]]$ is accepted in
\namee but rejected in \oname. This simplification is based on an important
observation: incoherence can only originate in merges. Therefore disjointness
checking is only necessary in \rref{T-merge}.
