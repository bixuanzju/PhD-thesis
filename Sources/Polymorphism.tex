\chapter{Semantics of the \fnamee Calculus}
\label{chap:fi}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this chapter, we are going to enrich \namee with parametric polymorphism. As
we will see in later chapters, the combination is very expressive, able to express sophisticated
concepts such as mixins/traits and a highly modular form of visitors. The
combination is also highly challenging in that coherence becomes even harder to
prove than in the simply typed setting. We present \fnamee, the first typed
calculus combining disjoint polymorphism with BCD subtyping. \fnamee is a
variant of \citeauthor{leivant1991finitely}'s predicative System
F~\citep{leivant1991finitely}. The choice of predicativity is due to the
simplicity of the coherence proof. We will further discuss this in
\cref{chap:coherence:poly}. \fnamee serves as the theoretical foundation of
typed first-class traits, which will be introduced in \cref{chap:traits}.
