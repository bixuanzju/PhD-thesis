\chapter{Semantics of the \fnamee Calculus}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this chapter, we present \fnamee, the first typed calculus combining disjoint
polymorphism with BCD subtyping. \fnamee is essentially a hybrid of \namee
(which does not support parametric polymorphism) and \fname (which does not
account for BCD subtyping). As we will see, the combination is very expressive,
enabling improved compositional designs and supporting automated composition of
interpretations in programming techniques like object
algebras~\citep{oliveira2012extensibility} and finally
tagless~\citep{CARETTE_2009}. Furthermore, as we will show in
\cref{chap:traits}, \fnamee is able to encode sophisticated concepts such as
mixins/traits and dynamic inheritance. Unfortunately, the combination also
introduces non-trivial complications. The main technical challenge (like for
most other calculi with disjoint intersection types) is the proof of
coherence---our main topic in \cref{chap:coherence:poly}.


The formalization and metatheory of \fnamee are a significant advance over its
predecessor \fname. Besides the support for distributive subtyping, \fnamee
removes several restrictions imposed by the syntactic coherence proof in \fname.
In particular \fnamee supports unrestricted intersections, which are forbidden
in \fname. Unrestricted intersections enable, for example, encoding certain
forms of bounded quantification~\citep{pierce1991programming}. Moreover the new
proof method is more robust with respect to language extensions. For instance,
\fnamee supports the bottom type without significant complications in the
proofs, while it was a challenging open problem in \fname. A final interesting
aspect is that \fnamee's type-checking is decidable. In the design space of
languages with polymorphism and subtyping, similar mechanisms have been known to
lead to undecidability. Pierce's seminal paper ``\emph{Bounded quantification is
  undecidable}''~\citep{pierce1994bounded} shows that the contravariant subtyping
rule for bounded quantification in \fsub leads to undecidability of subtyping.
In \fnamee the contravariant rule for disjoint quantification retains
decidability. Since with unrestricted intersections \fnamee can express several
use cases of bounded quantification, \fnamee could be an interesting and
decidable alternative to \fsub.
